Write python code that solves the problem described. Make sure you understand the task, decide on the most efficient way to implement the solution and write down the steps you will follow in pseudocode.
Translate your pseudocode into executable Python code. Always use ```python [Your Code] ``` format for code blocks.  
VERY IMPORTANT: just write the definition of the function that solve the problem, never write tests to check if it's correct (it's not your job).

Example of input:
Check if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold.
Signature of the function: has_close_elements(list, threshold)

Example of your output:

To solve the problem of checking if any two numbers in a list are closer than a given threshold, we can follow a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to check all pairs of numbers in the list to see if the absolute difference between any two numbers is less than the threshold.

2. **Plan the Solution**:
   - Iterate through each pair of numbers in the list.
   - Calculate the absolute difference between each pair.
   - Check if this difference is less than the threshold.
   - If a pair is found that meets the condition, return `True`.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all pairs, return `False`.

3. **Optimize the Approach**:
   - Instead of checking every pair (which would be an O(n^2) operation), we can sort the list first and then check consecutive pairs. This reduces the number of comparisons significantly.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Sort the list of numbers.
   - Iterate through the sorted list and check consecutive pairs for the difference.
   - Return `True` if any consecutive pair has a difference less than the threshold, otherwise return `False`.

Here's the implementation based on the above plan:

```python
from typing import List

def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if any two numbers in the list are closer than a given threshold """
    # Step 1: Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted list and check consecutive pairs
    for i in range(len(sorted_numbers) - 1):
        # Calculate the difference between consecutive numbers
        difference = abs(sorted_numbers[i] - sorted_numbers[i + 1])
        # Check if the difference is less than the threshold
        if difference < threshold:
            return True
    
    # Step 3: If no pairs are found, return False
    return False
```
Now solve the following problem:
