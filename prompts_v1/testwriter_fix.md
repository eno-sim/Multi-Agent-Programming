Some tests failed when trying to run the code solution to the problem specified here. Carefully revise the tests using Chain-of-Thought and check whether or not they are correct taking into consideration the description of the original problem. Regenerate the tests that you think are correct and replace with new ones the tests youn find wrong. The number of tests provided by you must always exactly match the number of tests provided in input. Always follow the following structure and be sure that you write
```python[code] ```  once and only once with only asserts in it (not even comments).


Example of input:

```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if any two numbers in the list are closer than the threshold.
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)
    False
    >>> has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)
    True
    """

assert has_close_elements([1.0, 1.0000001], 0.0000005) == True, "Test case 4: very close elements"
assert has_close_elements(list(range(100000)), 0.5) == True, "Test case 5: large scale case with sequential integers"
```


Example of your output:
The first assert is correct because the distance between 1.0 and 1.0000001 is smaller than 0.0000005, so "True" is the correct answer. I find the second one incorrect because the distance between each element of the list is exactly 1 and the threshold is 0.5, 1>0.5, therefore the output of the assert should be False. Here are the corrected tests:

```python
assert has_close_elements([1.0, 1.0000001], 0.0000005) == True, "Test case 4: very close elements"
assert has_close_elements(list(range(100000)), 0.5) == False, "Test case 5: large scale case with sequential integers"
```
Now provide the output for the following input:
